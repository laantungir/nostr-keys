# nostr-keys

## Advanced nostr key derivation.

Private keys for Nostr and cryptocurrencies are just very large random integers. They are all similar in that way. Once you generate that large random integer to create a private key for Nostr for example, you can also utilize that private key to generate Bitcoin addresses.

This package allows you to generate a private key, from which you can obtian a near limitless number of nostr keypairs, along with Bitcoin private keys and address, as well as many other cryptocurrencies.
